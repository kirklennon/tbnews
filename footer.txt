<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1156718096243019776">this tweet by
 Andy Baio</a>, this site searches Twitter for tweets where journalists are 
 asking for permission to use someone's video, and then shows the tweet they 
 were replying to. The whole thing is written in about 30 lines of python, plus 
 use of the Twython, urllib, and json libraries. There&rsquo;s no real need for 
 it to refresh live, so it just runs as a cron job every five minutes and 
 generates a static HTML page.</p>
